        <h2 class="mb-4"> I'm a junior front-end developer based in San Francisco, California</h2>
        <p>
        As an avid learner, I love to challenge myself and look for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills; whether learning new languages like French and Spanish or
        experimenting with new recipes, I always look forward to continuous learning and growth.
        <br>
        <br>
        As a former Preschool teacher and director, I have learned to be adaptable and flexible in any situation. I have also
        honed my skills in interpersonal communication, problem-solving, active-listening, time-management and empathy. However,
        I yearned for more, yearned for a new challenge and to learn something different.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I took the plunge and tried my hands in coding, I was instantly hooked. Coding speaks to me and it calls to all my
        passions; it incorporates creativity and problem-solving, and I’m allowed to break the code in order to improve it and
        have a better understanding of how it works.
        <br>
        <br>
        As I delved deeper into my coding journey, sparks flew when I realized the similarities between teaching and coding. As
        I used to always remind my students with this mantra “It’s OK to make mistakes, because that’s how we learn and grow.” I
        find that this message resonates with me because with coding, there’s always room for growth and improvement, and
        endless possibilities to solve a problem.
        <br>
        <br>
        I absolutely love to code and I want to use my skills to not only create things that have purpose and solve problems,
        but also to make the internet a better place for everyone and help humanity by building meaningful connections.
